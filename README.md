# ANPR using EasyOCR

This project demonstrates the use of EasyOCR library in Python for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images. It extracts text from an image, performs preprocessing tasks such as edge detection, contour detection, and cropping, and finally displays the recognized text along with bounding boxes on the original image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- EasyOCR
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Imutils

## Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python easyocr numpy matplotlib imutils
```

## Running 

```bash
python main.py
```
